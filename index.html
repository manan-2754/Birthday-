                <p>First of all i didn't knew i would be having a happy one year anniversay with you, i still cannot believe that i found 
                    such a beautiful girl like you and fell in love with your best soul ever. A year ago when i was in school i use to look for you in the
                    crowd so i can meet you, see you and be friends with you. Thank i guess you removed me from you chat list. And its funny how god made you text 
                    me back again and here we are, taking care of each other and loving each other. Lets take a look of our journey from the beggining.

                <p>So this was the first time we met. Just on a excuse of giving you a simple watch as a gift. Never thought that gift giving would turn into
                    bringing two souls very close to each other. Making each other happy and having in fall far each other. At the first time you told me that
                    i was too introvert and i took it sericously and starting talkignvery friendly and make you lagh more and more. At that time it started really 
                    interesting between us getting close, and understanding each other.

                <p> I still remember when we used to met after your Aakash classes and we used to find a good place where there were very less public around
                    and i use to love to bring you dairy milk chocolates at that time, daily and just enjoy having fun with you. Getting to know each other
                    give you advices on how to make eye contacts, and we used to practice that in dark and never knew i would fall in those beautifull eyes.
                    See you happy and making you happy was and is my most favourite thing. Because your smile make me feel that you're the most pretty girl ever.

                <p> I used to love to take you on small date, making you smile, make you happy, full filling all your food cravings and see you smile and happy.
                    People used to ask me why i was spending so much money on you. But i had just in my that money was not important to me, the most important thing
                    for me was to make you smile, make you happy, because i know how much you used to cry due to your studies, society and maybe due to me.But i never
                    to be that person who wannted to make you angry more, and make you sad. Because i love you. and i will always love you.

                <p>And here we are today, video calling each other from a very very long distance, giving each other strongest hopes and promises to meet again.
                    missing each other every day and night wishing we would be still together holding each others hand in hand. Making each other smile And
                    giving each other the best happiness we can. I know this all is going hard and it would be very tough for both of us upocming years.
                    But trust me when i say thay if you just hold my hand i can do anything for you, fight any situtation, making you happy in hard times,
